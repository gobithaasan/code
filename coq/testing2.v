These default coding systems were tried to encode text
in the buffer `SimpleStuff.v':
  (undecided-dos (266 . 8658) (284 . 8658) (303 . 8658))
  (iso-latin-1-dos (266 . 8658) (284 . 8658) (303 . 8658))
However, each of them encountered characters it couldn't encode:
  undecided-dos cannot encode these: ⇒ ⇒ ⇒
  iso-latin-1-dos cannot encode these: ⇒ ⇒ ⇒

Click on a character (or switch to this window by `C-x o'
and select the characters by RET) to jump to the place it appears,
where `C-u C-x =' will give information about it.

Select one of the safe coding systems listed below,
or cancel the writing with C-g and edit the buffer
   to remove or modify the problematic characters,
or specify any other coding system (and risk losing
   the problematic characters).
